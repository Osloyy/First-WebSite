<!-- Intro to HTML & CSS I

  Module Project Overview

    You will build a website to display the bio of your favorite programmer, artist, etc.

    In order to do this, you will create an `index.html` file and scaffold the document
    with the elements shared by all HTML documents:

    - doctype declaration
    - html element
    - head, containing a title and an optional style tag
    - body, containing the markup that renders to the screen

  Requirements

    Review this article: https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp

    Create an `index.html` file for your site, or use this same file.

    For your site, you will make use of at least the following semantic elements:

    - header (to contain the main heading of the site, and the nav)
    - nav (to contain some links to navigate to the different sections of this document)
    - section (each holding at least a heading and a paragraph)
    - aside (containing an img and a caption)
    - footer (containing a contact form)
    - form (containing at least two inputs with their labels)

    See an example of a finished site: https://bloominstituteoftechnology.github.io/img/anita-borg-bio-website.png

    The example above is quite simple, but you can make your site as fancy as you'd like. -->

          <p>Linus Torvalds is a software engineer from Finland who developed the Linux kernel, 
            which is a well-known operating system that powers most of the internet. In fact, most websites are hosted on Linux servers, 
            and it's also used for desktop use, but it's most likely not that well known for that. 
            Linus Torvalds started working on the Linux kernel in 1991 as a side project while in college. 
            At first, it wasn't that much until Linus made the project open-sourced, 
            which allowed the same people who used the operating system to work on it and add features to it that they saw fit for their needs or wants. 
            This made it so Linux has many different versions called distros,
            which are all based on what Linus worked on plus whatever they decide to add to the version of Linux. 
            With that being said, I think Linus is my favorite programmer and software developer in general, 
            and he quite motivates me to work on my own software ideas.</p>
